# [MusicFestNW Mobile Schedule](http://matthewmcvickar.github.io/musicfestnw-mobile-schedule/)

Go here on your phone: **[tinyurl.com/mfnw2014](http://matthewmcvickar.github.io/musicfestnw-mobile-schedule/)**

MusicFestNW's site is not responsive, so reading the schedule while you're at the festival is difficult.

This is a fits-on-one-screen schedule that you can bookmark or make into your lock screen background.

This is optimized for iPhones because that's what I have. ¯\\(ツ)/¯
